# k

An operating system kernel written in Rust targeting modern ARMv8 64-bit processors.

Right now the system only supports running on the QEMU `virt` board, but should be portable to most reasonable ARMv8 systems that can run U-Boot and have an available device tree at boot.

## Features:
- Debug UART output
- Virtual memory management
- Simple thread scheduler
- GICv2 interrupt controller support with v2m message-based interrupt support
- PCIe driver (work in progress)
- NVMe driver (work in progress)
